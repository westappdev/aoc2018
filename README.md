# Advent of Code 2018

Developers at [West](https://www.west.com/) participating in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for the third year running.

Here's our code!

## How should I contribute to this repo?
Create a new top level directory here under `aoc2018/`, typically named after the language you'll be using to solve the problems, and simply commit & push to `master` any solution files you create!

## Do we have our own AoC leaderboard?
We sure do! [Join the private leaderboard](https://adventofcode.com/2018/leaderboard/private) with code `110818-ec3008c1` to get competitive!
